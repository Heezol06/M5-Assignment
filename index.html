                This incredibly easy seafood dinner uses fresh pineapple and a teriyaki-style sauce for the classic
                sweet-and-tangy profile of Hawaiian shrimp. The pineapple also concentrates as it bakes and helps keep
                the rice mixture from becoming too dry.

            <h3>Recipie Title</h3>
            <p class="last-p-sizing">Itâ€™s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in butter,
                garlic and thyme and baste continuously as the steak finishes cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter
                does all sorts of wonderful things to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and adhering to
                the crust of the steak.</p>

        <div class="make-three-part">

            <h3>Recipie Title</h3>
            <p class="last-p-sizing">Sink your teeth into a delicious restaurant-style, hamburger recipe made from lean
                beef. Skip the
                prepackaged patties and take the extra time to craft up your own, and that little extra effort will be
                worth it. To make cheeseburgers, about 1 minute before burgers are done, top with sliced cheese;
                continue cooking until cheese begins to melt.

            <h3>Recipie Title</h3>
            <p class="last-p-sizing">Fried prawns do taste divine but they also add to your waistline. Take a look at
                this perfectly delightful recipe that's not only easy but also a healthy way of enjoying crispy fried
                prawns. Medium-sized prawns are coated in lime juice, turmeric, fennel powder, tamarind water, dipped in
                suji and fried crisp.</p>
