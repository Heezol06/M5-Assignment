                This incredibly easy seafood dinner uses fresh pineapple and a teriyaki-style sauce for the classic
                sweet-and-tangy profile of Hawaiian shrimp. The pineapple also concentrates as it bakes and helps keep
                the rice mixture from becoming too dry. Rather than spreading the rice to the far edges of the sheet
                pan, keep it closer to the center and layer the vegetables and shrimp on top. This way their juices seep
                right into the rice, and the teriyaki drizzle coats every bite.

                prepackaged patties and take the extra time to craft up your own, and that little extra effort will be
                worth it. To make cheeseburgers, about 1 minute before burgers are done, top with sliced cheese;
                continue cooking until cheese begins to melt.
